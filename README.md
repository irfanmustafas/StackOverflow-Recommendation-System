Python scripts to mine data from StackOverflow, preprocess it and then predict which tags belong to the question/post using multi-label LinearSVC and recommends similar questions using cosine distances

1. Mined StackOverflow and pre-processed the data.
2. Created a Supervised Learning Classification Model to Predict Tags
3. Created a Similarity Model to suggest similar questions by applying various Document Similarity Algorithms
